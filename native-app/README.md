# Machine Health App (React Native Expo)

Welcome to the Machine Health App, a React Native Expo project designed to evaluate the health of various machines in an automobile factory. This README will guide you on setting up and running the app, as well as understanding its structure.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (package manager)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for running Expo projects)

### Installation

```bash
yarn
```

### Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```


This will launch the Expo development server, and you can access the app on your device using the Expo Go app or an emulator. You can hit `i` or `a` on the keyboard to launch the ios or android app respectively.

### Additional Dependicies
```bash
npm install cors
```
This enables the two servers (backend and native-app to communicate). Verify dependency is added to package.json for native and backend.

```bash
yarn add cypress
```
This adds cypress for UI regression testing

### Cypress Setup
```bash
yarn run cypress open
```
In the browser that opens up, select E2E tests to configure and then Continue and finally select your preferred browser. This will create the necessary directories to run the cypress tests if you don't have them.
After initial setup, in the cypress window click "Start E2E testing in..." and select the layout specs "regression.cy.js" file kicking off the UI tests

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `App.tsx`: The entry point of the Expo app, where the navigation is configured.
- `components/`: Contains reusable components used throughout the app.
- `app/`: Contains individual screens or pages/tabs of the app.
- `data/`: Stores JSON files with machine and part data for evaluation.

## Screens and Features

The app has the following screens and features:

- **Machine Health**: Allows users to select a machine, part name, and part value, and calculates the health score of the machine.

## Adding Tests

You are free to choose how you'd like to test this repo, think about options and approaches and build out (and document!) what you think would be an appropriate testing infrastructure. Hint: think about a combo of unit tests and integration tests, there is an android APK in the root of the exercise if it's helpful.

## Customization

If you would like, feel free to modify the app as needed.
